Mighty Nein in Stardew Valley content patcher mod. https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/7419

This is a patched version of the wonderful Mighty Nein in Stardew Valley made by calicoJill. The original mod is incompatible with recent Stardew Valley updates (1.5.1 and beyond) and is buggy in some previous versions (1.4.5), and I didn't want this mod to be inaccessible for everyone playing properly updated versions of Stardew Valley.

New game content is still a work in progress. I am slowly but surely updating new dialogue, sprites, and portraits, but lots of the content that is added in versions 1.4 and beyond has not been modified. This means that some new sprites may appear with their original, non-Mighty Nein appearances; new dialogue is not modified to fit the tone of the Mighty Nein characters (although names are still substituted as needed); etc. This should primarily (if not exclusively) affect late-game content.

The most likely issues that may arise with this version will be graphical glitches, so please let me know if any items/people appear odd (or don't appear at all), as well as any crashes or other bugs you may experience.
